# Millionaire‚Äôs Dilemma

A secure protocol using [Inco Lightning](https://docs.inco.org/lightning/) that allows three participants (Alice, Bob, and Eve) to secretly submit their balances on-chain ‚Äî without revealing the values ‚Äî and determine who is the richest among them. Inspired by the classic *Millionaires' Problem* in cryptography.

## Contract Transactions 
I have used 0xD1213096a1BaD36FefA367f497EFd2177d51466c contract for demonstration in the video, You can view the transactions [here](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xd1213096a1bad36fefa367f497efd2177d51466c).
The testing is done [here](https://github.com/Haxry/Milli-Dilemma/blob/master/lightning-rod/contracts/src/test/TestRich.t.sol)
## ‚ö° How it Works

The core contract, [`RichestComparison`](https://github.com/Haxry/Milli-Dilemma/blob/master/lightning-rod/contracts/src/Rich.sol), is built using Inco Lightning, a library that allows encrypted computation on-chain. Participants submit encrypted values, and comparison is done securely using `euint256` and `ebool` types. No private value is ever revealed.

### Flow

1. **Deploy the contract** with Alice, Bob, and Eve‚Äôs wallet addresses.
2. Each participant **submits their encrypted balance** through the frontend.
3. After all submissions:
   - Anyone can click **"Compare"** to compute the richest participant.
   - Then click **"Reveal Winner"** to decrypt and finalize the result.
4. The result is emitted and stored publicly ‚Äî but without revealing any actual submitted values.

## üîê Inco Lightning Usage

This project uses [Inco Lightning](https://github.com/inco-org/inco-lightning) to:

- Accept encrypted values 
- Perform encrypted comparison 
- Allow contract to read/write encrypted data securely 

Lightning ensures sensitive information is kept private, while still allowing secure operations on-chain.
